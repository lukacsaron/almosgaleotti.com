## Introduction

During high school, I became passionate about art, music, art history, and contemporary art.  
This passion led me to enroll at university and complete a **Bachelor in Arts Management** at the **International Business School** in Budapest.

At that time, gastronomy was still a personal passion – a hobby cultivated alongside my studies.  
In 2019, I realized it was much more than that: not just an interest, but the **professional path I wanted to pursue**.  
That’s how art became my hobby, and food became my professional mission.

In 2020, I decided to start my training at **ALMA – The International School of Italian Cuisine**.  
Even though I knew I didn’t want to become “just a chef”, I was convinced that starting from hands-on practice was essential to gain a 360° understanding of the industry.  
I first attended the **Culinary Techniques Course**, followed by my first professional experience at **Antica Corte Pallavicina**, under Chef **Massimo Spigaroli**.

I later returned to ALMA for the **Advanced Course in Italian Cuisine**, completing my internship at **Mauro Uliassi (3★ Michelin)**, followed by a winter season at **St. Hubertus (3★ Michelin)** during **Michele Lazzarini’s** final year as Head Chef.  
I then went back to **Uliassi**, this time as a full-time employee.

In 2023, I broadened my horizons with an experience at **Boragó (World’s 50 Best, Santiago de Chile)** and a period at **Contrada Bricconi**, working again with my friend **Michele Lazzarini**.  
These experiences brought me closer to the side I’m most passionate about: the **organizational and managerial dimension** of gastronomy.

From October to December 2023, I had the opportunity to work as **Tutor for ALMA’s Food & Beverage Management Course**, combining managerial training with operational experience.  
In January 2024, I officially joined the **ALMA team** as **Educational & Project Manager**, becoming the right hand of **Chef Matteo Berti**, ALMA’s Didactic Director.
